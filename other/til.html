<ul>
  <li>"git stash" stores any changes you've made since the last commit.  "git stash list" lists all of your stashed changes.  "git stash apply" applies the most recent.  "git stash apply stash@{#}" applies that one only.
  <li>"git reset --hard" will reset your local git repo to the last commit I believe.  This is good if you've made changes you don't want to keep and just want to erase all of them or if you're trying to merge and it won't let you and you don't care about your changes.
  <li>"git checkout (some remote branch name)" doesn't pull the most recent changes.  "git pull origin (branchname)" must be used after the checkout.
  <li>Use "git branch -a" to see all branches available on the remote.  Then type "git checkout <i>branchname</i>" to access it.
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>If attempting to install Windows8 from a memory stick causes a /boot/BCD error, the BCD file on the memory stick is corrupt.  Either fix that (there may be backups in the same folder) or remake the memory stick.
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>"synclient" lists all available settings with their values.  "synclient (option)=(value)" will change that value.
