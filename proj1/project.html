<h1 class="headers" id="h1">About me:</h1>
<p>
My name is Troy Lonie (like low-knee) and I am a 30 year old computer science student at
CSU Fresno.  I should be graduating at the end of Fall 2013 if all goes well.  My interests
 include technology with an emphasis in computing and programming along with gaming,
 hiking, music and more.  I am originally from Lancaster Pennsylvania where I lived until I
 was around 15-16.  I then moved to Jacksonville Florida for a few years and finally Fresno
 California when I was almost 18.  I came out to California to work with my father who
 was managing a west coast branch of Pennsylvania's Ross Technology. <br>
 After working there I managed to get a job as a contractor in the IT department of Kaiser
 Permanente thanks to a good friend.  And then after around 2.5 years I decided to return to
 school to obtain my Bachelors degree.  At first I was a chemistry major but then switched
 to mechanical engineering which interested me more.  It was when I took a programming course
 as a GE for my engineering degree that I fell in love with programming.  I have not
 regretted the decision once and very much look forward to a career in software.<br>
 I have a sweet and loving fiance named Alicia Brookshire to whom I am going to be married to
 come May 30th.  We live in a rented condo near Peach and Ashlan in Fresno about 8 minutes
 from the campus.
