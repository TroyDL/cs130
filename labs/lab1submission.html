Answer 3: www.scamdex.com seems pretty decent.  Better than the other 5 I looked at.

Answer 4: It appears RFC's are proposal documents produced by the Internet Engineering Task Force which discuss different aspects of the internet and suggestions on how to improve it or modify it.  Some are then adopted as internet standards.  www.rfc-editor.org seems to be the best place to use the database.  It is also searchable by keyword or RFC number.  Assuming RFC numbers are created in numerical order and do not skip any numbers, there should be 6861, as that is the most recent rfc published.  It was created in Jan 2013, though it doesn't seem to have a day listed.  Its title was "The "create-form" and "edit-form" Link Relations"

Random Word: Freedom
<br>
Search Engine: Google.com

<ul><li>Site 1: http://macfreedom.com/
  <ol>
    <li> 1:B.  Well organized, not crowded.  Clean look to it.
    <li> 2:B.  Pretty good, there is a navigation bar at the top and the head of each new page has the same title as the one you clicked on the bar.  However, it would be better/clearer if the button on the navigation bar was highlighted in some way once you were on that page.
    <li> 3:A.  I think the site is pretty clear for someone interested in the product.  I think they would find what they're looking for fairly easily.  The only improvement I can think of is to have the navigation bar highlighted like I mentioned above.
  </ol>
  <li>Site 2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom
  <ol><li>1:A.  It's not exactly pretty, but it's attractive in a clean - utilitarian sense.  I'm a fan of wikipedia and I think their layout is just fine.
    <li>2:A.  It is very well organized, especially if familiar with wikipedia, as all the article structures are the same more or less.
    <li>3:A.  This is probably one of those most useful websites for someone looking for a quick overview of the definition and history of the random word I chose.  I cannot think of any improvements.
  </ol>

  <li>Site 3: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/freedom
  <ol><li>1:D.  The site is not attractive at all.  The actual content is wedged between advertisements for online quizzes and top 10 lists.  Some elements of the page will pop up a window if you hover over them and will not disappear until you click a small 'x'.  Very annoying.
    <li>2:C.  The structure seems alright, but finding your way to relevant links are not as clear as they should be, considering all the "trick" links that attempt to get people to click them thinking they're part of the actual website.
    <li>3:C.  They will see the definition, but will have to hunt to find anything further.  This is a terrible website, I am highly disappointed in such a well known brand doing this.  To improve it I would remove 90% of the ads and trick links and have a simple, obvious single advertisement at the top of the page only.  Currently the ads are completely surrounding the actual content.
  </ol>

  <li>Site 4: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/freedom
  <ol><li>1:B+.  This site has the same exact purpose of the last site but has about 80% less ads and has the content displayed better.  The ads it does have make hurt its attractiveness, but the layout of the content is pretty good overall.
    <li>2:B.  This site is organized fairly well.  Links are clear and so is the location of the current page.  I can tell where I am because the largest text on the screen is the word it is currently displaying the definition for.
    <li>3:A.  I think a primary user would be able to find exactly what he's looking for, and more, very easily.  I would get rid of the advertisement on the right hand site and just leave the one at the top of the page.  On small windows having ads to either side just squeezes the actual content too much.
  </ol>
  <li>Site 5: http://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Novel-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/0312576463
  <ol><li>1:A.  I like Amazon's site for the most part.  It is attractive with clear background colors for different important portions of the page.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but it does make me want to explore further.
    <li>2:A.  Very well organized.  Excellent link structure.  It is easy to see what page of the site you're currently on and how to go where you want to go as well.
    <li>3:A.  A person looking for this book will find a great deal of information about it.  The reviews posted by users are exceptionally helpful.  I doubt they would have to hunt much to find what they're looking for.  The only improvement I would suggest is to improve their search engine.  It's kind of terrible if you're looking for something really specific because it tends to search for synonyms of your search criteria or related items more than the exact thing you're searching for.  Very frustrating.

<p>Javascript App
  The app I found was called Digg Attack.  It's a simple game where you have floating soldiers
  that move to where you click on the canvas and shoot in the direction of your cursor when you
  press CTRL.  Enemies spawn from what seems like a random direction and of varying strength
  which you have to defeat to get to the next level.  It has a soundtrack and is apparently
  tied into social networks in a way that relates to when a new enemy is spawned somehow.
  There will probably be data structures to represent enemy objects and algorithms to determine
  how everything moves.
